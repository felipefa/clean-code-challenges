# Rules in Conditionals

In this challenge, you will put into practice everything you just learned in the `Rules in Conditionals` lesson of the **Clean Code** course.

# About the challenge

The code you will practice these concepts on contains a function that checks whether a student will pass or fail at the end of the school year.

To pass, there are two rules:

- Your grade must be greater than 7
- Your absences must be less than 100

Your goal in this code is not to correct or implement its functionality, as it already works, but to reorganize the code in a way that applies what you have learned about rules in conditionals.
