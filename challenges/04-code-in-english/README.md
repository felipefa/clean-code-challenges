# Code in English

In this challenge, you will put into practice everything you just learned in the `Code in English` lesson of the Clean Code course.

# About the challenge

The code in which you will practice these concepts contains the logic of a React component that filters a list of products to display only the products that the user searches for when typing in the input.

Your goal in this code is not to fix or implement its functionality, as it already works, but you should rename variables or even object attributes according to what was learned, giving meaning to the variables according to the rules mentioned above.
