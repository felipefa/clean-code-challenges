# Parameters and Destructuring

In this challenge, you will put into practice everything you just learned in the `Parameters and Destructuring` lesson of the **Clean Code** course.

# About the challenge

The code you will practice these concepts on contains functions that handle updating user data from a route that will receive the following data:

`body: { name, email, password }`

`params: { id }`

Your goal in this code is to apply the concepts learned in the lesson to make the code clearer about what the `body`, `params`, and `data` parameters receive. No functionality implementation is required to complete the challenge.
