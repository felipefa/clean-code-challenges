# Booleans

In this challenge, you will put into practice everything you just learned in the `Clean Code with Booleans` lesson of the **Clean Code** course.

# About the challenge

The code you will practice these concepts on contains logic that represents Diego's visit to an amusement park, Rocket Park, to ride his favourite ride.

To enter the park, there are some rules:

- You need to have a ticket
- The park is open from 9am to 6pm

To ride his favourite ride, Diego just needs to be taller than 130cm.

Your goal in this code is not to fix or implement its functionality, as it already works, but to rename variables or even object attributes according to what was learned, giving meaning to the variables according to the rules above.
