# Magic Numbers

In this challenge, you will put into practice everything you just learned in the `Magic Numbers` lesson of the **Clean Code** course.

# About the challenge

The code you will practice these concepts on contains functions that deal with checking for updates in an application and calculating discounts, where:

1. The update check time using `setInterval` is done every 30 minutes.
2. The discount calculations should have the price in cents and the discount in percentage.

Your goal in this code is to apply the concepts learned in the lesson by providing more clarity to the code about what these magic numbers refer to. No functionality implementation is required to complete the challenge.
