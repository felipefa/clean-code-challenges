# Variable Naming

In this challenge, you will put into practice everything you have just learned in the `Variable Naming` lesson of the **Clean Code** course.

# About the challenge

The code in which you will practice these concepts consists of a function that receives a Github username and returns the same user with a category.

The categories will be assigned to the user based on the number of their followers on Github, where if the number of followers is greater than or equal to the minimum number required for each category, the category with the highest possible `minimum number of followers` will be returned.

The categories are as follows:

- **User**: I need at least 5 followers to receive this category
- **Friendly:** I need at least 50 followers to receive this category
- **Famous**: I need at least 500 followers to receive this category
- **Super** **Star**: I need at least 1000 followers to receive this category

Your goal in this code is not to correct or implement its functionality, as it already works, but you should rename variables or even object attributes according to what was learned, giving meaning to the variables according to the rules above.
