# Comments vs Documentation

In this challenge, you will put into practice everything you just learned in the `Comments vs Documentation` lesson of the **Clean Code** course.

# About the challenge

The code you will practice these concepts on contains a function responsible for registering the user in the database. However, before registering the user in the database, some steps need to be performed:

- Validations
- Conversion of the avatar to JPG.

Your goal in this code is to apply the concepts learned in the lesson, removing as many comments as possible. Remember that it is valid to rewrite a piece of code to make it clearer, thus dispensing the need for a comment.
